### main
simple hero page with animated photo, look for other hero pages for inspiration, probably try to do a whole photo as background thing, probably more generic than anything

### libraries
each library has an explanation of the library, as well as the shelves it has
- shelf 1
- shelf 2
- etc

### shelf
each shelf has rows, each row has a carousel of books

Maybe design this part to be an actual shelf? Lot's of work, but that in the backburner, buttons first

## Note on books
The books are arranged in the carousel in a specific order, specific shelf, probably just admin site that shit
